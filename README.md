# xAPI LMS profile for Open Education

This documentation describes LMS xAPI profile defined by the Gaia-X organisation.
It intends to modelise common and generic action that can performed on an LMS or any e-learning application.

> This profile is intended to be enriched iteratively by adding new descriptions of generic actions that would not be described in an already released xAPI profile.
> Through the progressive addition of new templates, the profile can be restructured and categories of statement templates defined.
